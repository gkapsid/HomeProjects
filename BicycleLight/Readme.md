# [Kitronik Rear Bike Light Project Kit](https://grobotronics.com/kitronik-rear-bike-light-project-kit.html)

This is the implementation of a kit that I bought from [Grobotronics](https://grobotronics.com/). It is a pure electronics, no code project!

The kit was very easy to assembly, althought I didn't find the schematic included. The placement of the materials is pretty straightforward except the placement of the three resistances were extra care should be taken because they have two different values.

There is plenty of information [here](https://resources.kitronik.co.uk/pdf/2106_rear_bike_light_essentials_2_0.pdf)

I did the following (minor) modifications: 

1. I replaced the red LEDs with white in order to be used in front.
2. I added a central ON/OFF switch.
3. I added a box in order to attach the kit on my bike.

Overall it was a short and useful project!

Have fun!
