# Simple Lightsaber toy

This is another ATTiny85 project. 

It's a toy with some functionality resampling the legendary Star Wars lightsaber.

The saber can:

* Light in color RED
* Light in a Rainbow effect (May the Rainbow magic be with you!)
* Light off when not in hand. 

## Bill of materials

1. An old toy
2. An ATtiny85 (maybe a 45 is also enough but not tested)
3. A few neopixel addresable LEDs.
4. A 330 Ohm and a 10K resistance
5. An IR sensor (a pressure sensor is probably better for this scenario)
6. A battery holder (if it isn't already part of the toy)

A video of the project can be found

A simulation of the project were the schematic can be found is in the following Tinkercad project https://www.tinkercad.com/things/4PYDB91v022
