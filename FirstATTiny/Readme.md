# First ATTiny projects

## Introduction

This folder contains my first two projects with the ATTiny 25/45/85 series ucontroller.

The first project implements a car and pedestrian traffic light (5 outputs) without any input from the user. 

The second project is the control of two NEOPIXELs and the read of a custom light sensor. If the light is above some value the lights are on and light according a "rainbow" effect. Other effects can also be implemented. 

Both projects are modification of older implementations, replacing the Arduino boards that were used back then. That way an Arduino micro and an Arduino Leonardo were spared for future, larger projects. 

Both projects are presented in brief in the YT video: 

They are also  implemented and simulated in Tinkercad where someone can find information about the connections between the elements and the code that it was used.
