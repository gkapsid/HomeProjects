The Jeep was wired remote controled (forward, backward, left right).

The following modifications have been made:

* The wired remote control was removed
* The following were used:
  * Arduino UNO
  * HC-05 Bluetooth module
  * Active buzzer
  * White LEDs
  * Red LEDs
  * 2x18650 3200 mAh Batteries and battery holders
  * Switch
  * Transistors
  * Servo motor

The idea was to install lights (front and back), horn, steering capabilities (the front motor which was for turning left, right was missing) and bluetooth connectivity.
