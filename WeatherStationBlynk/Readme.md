# Home Weather Station

This is a small home weather station that publishes the indoor temperature and humidity and the outdoor temperature. The values are published using the Blynk IoT dashboard and Android App.
The microcontroller is an ESP8266-12. It is powered by a USB cable through a 3V3 voltage regulator. The indoor values are measured using a DHT-11 module. The outdoor temperature is measured using a PT1000 temperature sensor in a voltage divider configuration. 

It is a simple yet usefull project.
